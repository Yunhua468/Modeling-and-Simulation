HW1. 1) Probability questions from book "Mathematics for Computer Science" in chapter15  
HW1. 2) program supermarket simulation  
There is a single line at a supermarket that can  feed up to 6 cash register lines. A supervisor decides based on the backlog in the single line how many of the cash register lines to have open (there are more than enough employees to have all the lines serviced). Customers arrive at the single line at the rate of 6.0/min+/-2.0 minutes intervals. It takes 12.0 min+/-3.0 min to checkout a customer.   
There is a tradeoff between too many cash registers  open and customers waiting. Once the single line reaches x people, the supervisor opens another register line. What should x be? When the line gets small go back to one register line.  
Use basic random number generator U(0,1] in the computer it is a double precision number.  
Start with one register line.
